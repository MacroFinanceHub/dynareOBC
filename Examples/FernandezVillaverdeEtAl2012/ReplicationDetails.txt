This folder contains the files for the various versions of the Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2012) model considered in the paper.
The main MOD files to run are "NK.mod", "NKPL.mod" and "NKIndexationAccuracy.mod".
The other MOD files are from the Dynare transformation engine available from here: https://github.com/tholden/DynareTransformationEngine
(The Dynare transformation engine assists in defining model local variables reducing model creation speed, and ensuring that all endogenous variables are meaningful over the whole real line.)

To test the properties of these models, run:

dynareOBC NK.mod timetoescapebounds=200 FeasibilityTestGridSize=10 MaxParametricSolutionDimension=0
dynareOBC NKPriceTargeting.mod timetoescapebounds=200 FeasibilityTestGridSize=10 MaxParametricSolutionDimension=0 ptest=20 usevpa
